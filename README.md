# Decentralized-Distributed-Files


I have stopped this for now because there were a few issues with the design.

The issue was that when the number of lookup nodes were small we might not have any lookup near storage nodes this would imply that some storage nodes would be un reachable...

Although we can fix this with a dynamic bucket etc. not really sure....

I will just implement one type of node in main for now might continue later
